# Kafka Transport (Future Implementation)

This package will contain the Kafka transport implementation for go-messagex.

## Status

ðŸš§ **Work in Progress** - This is a stub package for future Kafka implementation.

## Planned Features

- Kafka producer/consumer implementation
- Topic management and configuration
- Partition handling and load balancing
- Schema registry integration
- Exactly-once semantics support
- Stream processing capabilities

## Migration Path

The Kafka implementation will follow the same transport-agnostic interfaces defined in `pkg/messaging/`, ensuring seamless migration from RabbitMQ to Kafka.

## TODO

- [ ] Implement Kafka producer
- [ ] Implement Kafka consumer
- [ ] Add topic management utilities
- [ ] Integrate with schema registry
- [ ] Add performance optimizations
- [ ] Comprehensive testing suite

## Contributing

This package is not yet ready for contributions. Please focus on the RabbitMQ implementation first.
